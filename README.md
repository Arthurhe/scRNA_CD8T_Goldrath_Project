The Rdata files were generated by running "Generate_Rdata.R". The "cellrangerRkit" R package is already deprecated, so the script can not run on machine without cellrangerRkit installed. An alternative for this is to load data using Seurat.

Figure generation was done by running "Fig for Goldrath.ipynb"
